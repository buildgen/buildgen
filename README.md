# BuildGen

BuildGen is a cross-platform build tool.  It's goal is to allow your project to
be built on any system without any changes to the configuration.  It has an
extensible infrastructure that allows external libraries to be created and used
but it maintains a core set of "standard libraries" that are guaranteed to be
available on every system.
